Two base stations running with antennas side-by-side. Aim is to compare the pseudoranges etc from two identical 
receivers with their antennas as close a possible to each other (about 5cm).

Looking as pseudoranges vs time, both A and B receivers show a simlar curve with a signifant offset. 
That offset however seems to be either drifting or converging. Carrier phase is showing a similar
trend. Need a longer run to figure if this is drift or a convergence (ie is the receiver clock slowly
converging to the SV's time).
